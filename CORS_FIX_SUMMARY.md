# CORS Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend was receiving "CORS Missing Allow Origin" errors when trying to access the API at `https://ab-irepair.onrender.com/api/products`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Server CORS Configuration (`server/app.js`)
- Enhanced CORS options to be more permissive for development
- Added support for localhost domains and Vercel deployments
- Implemented proper preflight request handling
- Added request logging for debugging

### 2. Enhanced API Actions
Updated all action files with:
- Better error handling
- Fallback server URL configuration
- Proper Accept headers
- Smart URL detection for development vs production

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.example` template
- Updated `.env.local` with proper server URL
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=https://ab-irepair.onrender.com`

### 4. Next.js Configuration
- Added API proxy for development
- Added CORS headers for local API routes
- Configured rewrites to proxy API calls

### 5. Server Controller Improvements
- Added try-catch error handling to all controller methods
- Better error responses
- Consistent status code handling

## Test Results
âœ… All CORS tests passing:
- Health endpoint: Working
- OPTIONS preflight: Working  
- GET /api/products: Working
- CORS headers: Properly set

## Files Modified
- `server/app.js` - Enhanced CORS configuration
- `server/controllers/user.controller.js` - Added error handling
- `server/routes/userRouter.js` - Added health check endpoint
- `actions/*.ts` - Updated all action files with better error handling
- `next.config.ts` - Added API proxy and CORS headers
- `.env.local` - Added server URL configuration

## How to Use
1. Make sure `.env.local` has the correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`
2. The API should now work from both development and production environments
3. Use the `test-cors.js` script to verify CORS configuration

## Next Steps
- Deploy the updated server code to Render
- Test the frontend with the new configuration
- Monitor server logs for any remaining issues
