# Order Management & Telegram Integration

This update adds comprehensive order management and Telegram bot integration to the ABTECH iREPAIR system.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Order Processing
- **Order IDs**: Each order now gets a unique UUID
- **Complete Customer Info**: Stores full customer details including shipping address
- **Order Status Tracking**: Orders have status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- **Database Schema**: Updated to handle complete order information

### 2. Telegram Bot Integration
- **Automatic Notifications**: Orders are automatically sent to Telegram admins
- **Rich Order Details**: Includes customer info, items, total price, and payment information
- **Payment Verification**: Shows bank transfer ID for payment verification
- **HTML Formatting**: Clean, readable order notifications
- **Error Handling**: Order processing continues even if Telegram notification fails

### 3. Receipt Generation & Printing
- **Digital Receipt**: Comprehensive receipt with payment information displayed on thank you page
- **Print Function**: Print-optimized receipt with proper styling
- **Download Option**: Download receipt as text file
- **Order Storage**: Order data stored in localStorage for receipt display

## How It Works

### Order Flow
1. Customer places order on checkout page with bank transfer details
2. Order is saved to database with unique ID and payment transfer ID
3. Telegram notification sent to admin users with payment information
4. Customer redirected to thank you page with receipt
5. Receipt can be printed or downloaded
6. Admin can verify payment using the transfer ID

### Payment System
- **Bank Transfer Only**: No credit card information is stored
- **Transfer ID Required**: Customers must provide bank transfer reference ID
- **Payment Verification**: Payment status can be updated by admin
- **Secure Processing**: No sensitive payment data stored in system
