# Order Management & Telegram Integration

This update adds comprehensive order management and Telegram bot integration to the ABTECH iREPAIR system.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Order Processing
- **Order IDs**: Each order now gets a unique UUID
- **Complete Customer Info**: Stores full customer details including shipping address
- **Order Status Tracking**: Orders have status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- **Database Schema**: Updated to handle complete order information

### 2. Telegram Bot Integration
- **Automatic Notifications**: Orders are automatically sent to Telegram admins
- **Rich Order Details**: Includes customer info, items, and total price
- **HTML Formatting**: Clean, readable order notifications
- **Error Handling**: Order processing continues even if Telegram notification fails

### 3. Receipt Generation & Printing
- **Digital Receipt**: Comprehensive receipt displayed on thank you page
- **Print Function**: Print-optimized receipt with proper styling
- **Download Option**: Download receipt as text file
- **Order Storage**: Order data stored in localStorage for receipt display

## How It Works

### Order Flow
1. Customer places order on checkout page
2. Order is saved to database with unique ID
3. Telegram notification sent to admin users
4. Customer redirected to thank you page with receipt
5. Receipt can be printed or downloaded

  "customerInfo": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA",
    "zipCode": "10001"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": "PROD123",
      "name": "iPhone 13",
      "price": 999.99,
      "quantity": 1
    }
